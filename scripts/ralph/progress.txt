## Codebase Patterns
- HUD.cs located at Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/TowerSurvivors/UI/HUD.cs contains all UI update methods
- Use TextMeshProUGUI references for UI text elements in Unity scripts
- Health bar colors should be set programmatically in UpdateTowerHealthDisplay method
- Hide unused UI elements by setting SetActive(false) in OnGameStateChanged method
- Use <b> tags in TextMeshPro for bold text formatting

## 2026-02-06 19:05:00 - US-040
- Redesigned Top HUD Bar - Wave Counter and Health Bar
- Files changed: Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/TowerSurvivors/UI/HUD.cs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - HUD.cs is the main UI controller for all HUD elements
  - Wave text formatting uses TextMeshPro rich text tags like <b> for bold numbers
  - Health bar colors are applied to fillRect and background Image components  
  - Added m_TowerHealthText field for displaying HP text with heart icon
  - Hidden unwanted elements (survival time, wave progress, next wave timer, enemies) by setting SetActive(false)
  - Health display format: "♥ [current] / [max]" shows clearly readable HP values

- Added Pause Button to Top-Right in HUD.cs
- Files changed: Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/TowerSurvivors/UI/HUD.cs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Button references need to be added to [Header("Buttons")] section of HUD.cs
  - Subscribe to button onClick events in SubscribeToEvents() method
  - Button visibility controlled in OnGameStateChanged() - only show during GameState.Playing
  - Remember to unsubscribe from button events in OnDestroy() to prevent memory leaks
  - PauseGame() method exists on TowerSurvivorsGameManager and can be called directly
  - Unity Button UI elements require onClick.AddListener() pattern for event handling
