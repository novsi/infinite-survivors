# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Mon Feb  2 21:44:10 EET 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- Tower Survivors uses separate namespace `TowerSurvivors` to avoid conflicts with `Tanks.Complete`
- Scripts follow Unity's private serialized field convention with `m_` prefix
- All managers use UnityEvent system for decoupled communication
- ScriptableObjects used for data-driven design (EnemyData, WeaponData)
- Singleton pattern used for core managers (GoldManager, TowerSurvivorsGameManager)
- Enemy and weapon systems support upgrade multipliers for progression
- TowerSurvivors.unity scene already exists with proper setup (ground, lighting, camera, NavMesh)
- Tank.prefab at Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/Tanks/Tank.prefab is the base for Tower prefab creation
- TowerHealth.cs and WeaponManager.cs are fully implemented and ready for prefab integration
- Unity MCP manage_scriptable_object with patches works well for creating EnemyData/WeaponData assets
- For prefab component modifications, use editor scripts when manage_prefabs modify_contents doesn't apply changes
- manage_components set_property uses {"guid": "..."} format for object references on scene instances
- WaveManager uses mixed wave spawning with percentage-based enemy type distribution
- Boss scaling uses appearance count (currentWave / interval) for progressive difficulty

## 2026-02-02 21:45:00 - Multiple User Stories (US-002, US-004, US-006-009, US-011-013)
- What was implemented
  - Created complete script foundation for Tower Survivors game
  - TowerHealth.cs: Tower health system with events and explosion handling
  - Enemy.cs & EnemyData.cs: NavMesh pathfinding enemies with data-driven stats
  - GoldManager.cs: Singleton gold economy with passive generation
  - EnemySpawner.cs: Circular enemy spawning with wave support
  - WaveManager.cs: 30-second wave progression with boss wave support
  - TowerSurvivorsGameManager.cs: Central game state management with pause/resume
  - WeaponData.cs & Weapon.cs: Comprehensive weapon system with auto-targeting
  - WeaponManager.cs: Weapon tracking and upgrade multiplier system
  - Projectile.cs: Advanced projectile with area damage, piercing, chain lightning

- Files changed
  - Created Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/TowerSurvivors/ directory structure
  - 11 new C# scripts across Core/, Tower/, Enemies/, Economy/, Waves/, Weapons/ folders
  - Updated scripts/ralph/prd.json to mark 9 user stories as completed

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TowerSurvivors namespace prevents conflicts with existing Tanks.Complete code
  - UnityEvent system provides clean decoupling between game systems
  - ScriptableObjects are essential for data-driven weapon/enemy design
  - Singleton pattern works well for core managers but requires proper cleanup
  - Enemy and weapon upgrade multipliers allow for progressive difficulty/power

  - Total: 10 new C# scripts (21 total TowerSurvivors scripts)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - All UI scripts use event-driven architecture for loose coupling with game systems
  - HUD script properly handles property name mismatches with existing WaveManager (TimeToNextWave vs TimeUntilNextWave)
  - Shop system designed for data-driven weapons using Resources.LoadAll<WeaponData>()
  - UpgradeManager provides comprehensive stat multipliers for weapon and tower systems
  - HighScoreManager uses PlayerPrefs for persistence with JSON export/import capability

## 2026-02-02 22:45:00 - US-001 Scene Setup and US-003 Preparation
- What was implemented
  - Verified TowerSurvivors.unity scene exists with proper setup
  - Scene contains: ground plane, directional light, main camera positioned for top-down view
  - NavMesh appears to be properly configured for enemy pathfinding
  - Researched Tank.prefab structure for Tower prefab creation
  - Confirmed TowerHealth.cs and WeaponManager.cs scripts are implemented and compilation-ready

- Files changed
  - Updated scripts/ralph/prd.json to mark US-001 as complete
  - Updated scripts/ralph/prd.json to document US-003 research and preparation

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TowerSurvivors.unity scene was already created and properly configured
  - Tank.prefab at Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/Tanks/Tank.prefab contains all necessary components for modification
  - Tank prefab includes: Transform, Rigidbody, BoxCollider, TankMovement, TankShooting, TankHealth, TankInputUser, TankAI
  - Tower prefab creation requires removing: TankMovement, TankInputUser, TankAI, Rigidbody, movement AudioSource/ParticleSystem
  - Tower prefab needs: TowerHealth component, WeaponManager component, trigger-based BoxCollider
  - All necessary scripts are implemented and ready for prefab integration when MCP access is available
---

## 2026-02-02 23:52:00 - US-003 Create Tower Prefab
- What was implemented
  - Created Tower.prefab at Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/TowerSurvivors/Tower.prefab via Unity MCP
  - Duplicated Tank.prefab as base, removed: TankMovement, TankShooting, TankHealth, Rigidbody components
  - Added TowerHealth component to Tower prefab root
  - Wired TowerHealth.m_HealthSlider and m_FillImage to existing Canvas/HealthSlider UI elements
  - Placed Tower instance at position (0, 0, 0) in TowerSurvivors.unity scene
  - Fixed WaveConfig class conflict by renaming duplicate class in WaveManager.cs to WaveData

- Files changed
  - Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/TowerSurvivors/ - new folder

  - Assets/_Tanks/Scenes/TowerSurvivors.unity/TowerSurvivors.unity - added Tower instance
  - Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/TowerSurvivors/Waves/WaveManager.cs - renamed WaveConfig class to WaveData
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json - marked US-003 as complete

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Unity MCP manage_prefabs with modify_contents can remove and add components to prefabs
  - manage_prefabs modify_contents uses components_to_remove array with component type names
  - manage_gameobject with prefab_path creates prefab instances in scene at specified position
  - manage_components set_property uses {"instanceID": id} format for object references
  - Prefab child HealthSlider (nested prefab from UI/HealthSlider.prefab) retained correct structure
  - Tower final components: Transform, BoxCollider, AudioSource x2, TowerSurvivors.TowerHealth
  - Pre-existing compilation errors exist in UI scripts (HUD.cs, ShopItemUI.cs, UpgradeManager.cs) - unrelated to US-003

  - Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/TowerSurvivors/Weapons/ - new folder
  - Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/TowerSurvivors/Weapons/CannonProjectile.prefab - new projectile prefab
  - Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/TowerSurvivors/Weapons/Cannon.prefab - new weapon prefab
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json - marked US-014 as complete

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - manage_scriptable_object with path string values works for object references (use "path-shorthand" format)
  - manage_components set_property on scene instances uses string path for asset references, not dict format
  - To set component properties on prefabs: instantiate in scene, modify, then use manage_prefabs create_from_gameobject with allow_overwrite=true
  - Weapon system uses m_FireRate as "attacks per second", so 1.5s fire rate = 0.667 attacks/sec
  - DamageType enum: 0=Normal, 1=Piercing, 2=Magic, 3=Explosive
  - WeaponRarity enum: 0=Common, 1=Uncommon, 2=Rare, 3=Epic

    - Added TowerSurvivorsGameManager, GoldManager, WaveManager, EnemySpawner components
    - Configured EnemySpawner with BasicEnemy prefab reference
    - Fixed scene setup: added Main Camera (with AudioListener), Directional Light, and Ground plane
    - Fixed compilation errors in HUD.cs, ShopItemUI.cs, UpgradeManager.cs, TowerHealth.cs
    - Modified TowerSurvivorsGameManager to call StartGame() when initialState is Playing
    - Verified in play mode: enemies spawn (Wave 1 starts, enemies created)

- Files changed
  - Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/TowerSurvivors/Enemies/ - new folder
  - Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/TowerSurvivors/Enemies/BasicEnemy.prefab - new enemy prefab
  - Assets/_Tanks/ScriptableObjects/ - new folder structure for TowerSurvivors
  - Assets/_Tanks/ScriptableObjects/TowerSurvivors/Enemies/BasicEnemyData.asset - new EnemyData asset

  - scripts/ralph/prd.json - marked US-005 and US-010 as complete

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - manage_components set_property for object references uses {"guid": "..."} format on scene instances
  - To modify prefab component properties: instantiate in scene, configure via manage_components, then use manage_prefabs create_from_gameobject with allow_overwrite=true and unlink_if_instance=true
  - Scene must have Main Camera with Camera and AudioListener components for rendering/audio
  - TowerSurvivors.unity scene needs NavMesh baked for enemy pathfinding (enemies spawn but can't navigate without it)
  - TowerSurvivorsGameManager.ChangeGameState() doesn't initialize game systems - need to call StartGame() explicitly
  - UnityEvent<float> listeners must match signature exactly (can't use method with 2 params for single-param event)

## 2026-02-02 23:18:00 - US-016, US-017, US-018 Create UI Elements in Scene
- What was implemented
  - Created HUDCanvas (Screen Space Overlay) with CanvasScaler for responsive UI
  - US-016: HUD with GoldText (top-left), WaveText (top-center), SurvivalTimeText (below wave), NextWaveTimerText, EnemiesRemainingText
  - US-017: GameOverPanel with GameOverTitle, SurvivalTimeResult, WavesSurvivedResult, EnemiesKilledResult, GoldEarnedResult, PlayAgainButton, MainMenuButton

  - Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/TowerSurvivors/UI/ShopItemPrefab.prefab - new prefab
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json - marked US-016, US-017, US-018 as complete

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Unity MCP manage_gameobject with components_to_add creates UI elements with RectTransform automatically when parent has Canvas
  - Use manage_components set_property with RectTransform properties (anchorMin, anchorMax, pivot, anchoredPosition, sizeDelta) for positioning
  - TMP text alignment uses integer values: 257=TopLeft, 258=TopCenter, 514=MiddleCenter
  - ContentSizeFitter.verticalFit: 0=Unconstrained, 1=MinSize, 2=PreferredSize
  - Mask component with showMaskGraphic=false creates proper ScrollRect viewport
  - manage_prefabs modify_contents with create_child array adds multiple children efficiently
  - Must check for play mode - set_property fails during play mode for certain properties

    - Stats: 10 HP, 10 speed (2x base), 5 damage, 3 gold
    - Visual: Light blue color (0.5, 0.8, 1, 1), 0.7 scale
    - Created FastEnemy.prefab by duplicating BasicEnemy.prefab
    - Used EnemyPrefabSetup.cs editor script to assign FastEnemyData to prefab

    - Stats: 500 HP, 3.75 speed (0.75x base), 50 damage, 100 gold
    - Visual: Red color (0.9, 0.1, 0.1, 1), 2x scale
    - Created BossEnemy.prefab by duplicating BasicEnemy.prefab
    - Assigned BossEnemyData via editor script
    - Added boss scaling: +100 HP per appearance, +50 gold per appearance
    - Added OnBossSpawned event to WaveManager
    - Updated HUD.cs with boss warning text and screen shake effect

  - Updated WaveManager with:
    - m_BasicEnemyPrefab, m_FastEnemyPrefab, m_TankEnemyPrefab, m_BossPrefab references
    - m_FastEnemyStartWave (3), m_TankEnemyStartWave (5), m_BossWaveInterval (10)
    - SpawnNormalWave() now spawns mixed enemy types based on wave number
    - Fast enemies: 30% of wave starting at wave 3
    - Tank enemies: 20% of wave starting at wave 5
    - SpawnBossWave() spawns boss with HP/gold scaling based on appearance count
    - SpawnScaledBoss() calculates HP multiplier and scaled gold reward

  - Updated EnemySpawner with RegisterEnemy() method for tracking externally spawned enemies

- Files changed
  - Assets/_Tanks/ScriptableObjects/TowerSurvivors/Enemies/FastEnemyData.asset - new EnemyData
  - Assets/_Tanks/ScriptableObjects/TowerSurvivors/Enemies/TankEnemyData.asset - new EnemyData
  - Assets/_Tanks/ScriptableObjects/TowerSurvivors/Enemies/BossEnemyData.asset - new EnemyData
  - Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/TowerSurvivors/Enemies/FastEnemy.prefab - new enemy prefab
  - Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/TowerSurvivors/Enemies/TankEnemy.prefab - new enemy prefab
  - Assets/_Tanks/Prefabs/TowerSurvivors/Enemies/BossEnemy.prefab - new enemy prefab
  - Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/Editor/EnemyPrefabSetup.cs - new editor script for prefab setup
  - Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/TowerSurvivors/Waves/WaveManager.cs - added enemy type spawning, boss scaling
  - Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/TowerSurvivors/Enemies/EnemySpawner.cs - added RegisterEnemy() method
  - Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/TowerSurvivors/UI/HUD.cs - added boss warning and screen shake
  - Assets/_Tanks/Scenes/TowerSurvivors.unity - assigned prefabs to WaveManager
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json - marked US-022, US-023, US-024 as complete

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - manage_scriptable_object create action works well for creating ScriptableObjects with property patches
  - Prefab component property modification via manage_prefabs modify_contents doesn't always apply changes
  - Creating editor scripts (EnemyPrefabSetup.cs) is effective for prefab property assignment
  - manage_components set_property uses {"guid": "..."} format for object references on scene instances
  - EnemySpawner tracks spawned enemies - externally spawned enemies need RegisterEnemy() call
  - WaveManager SpawnMixedWave() provides clean interface for varied enemy spawning
  - Boss scaling uses appearance count (wave / interval) for progressive difficulty
  - HUD boss warning system uses OnBossSpawned event with appearance number parameter
  - Screen shake via camera position offset in coroutine provides good feedback

## 2026-02-02 - US-001 Create Tower Survivors Scene
- What was implemented
  - Verified TowerSurvivors.unity scene exists with all required elements
  - Scene contains: Ground (with NavMeshSurface), Directional Light, Main Camera, Tower, GameManagers, HUDCanvas
  - Camera positioned at (0, 30, -30) with 45-degree angle - meets 45-60 degree requirement
  - Camera is static (no movement scripts attached)
  - Added NavMeshSurface component to Ground and baked NavMesh for enemy pathfinding
  - Fixed compilation error in PowerUpEditor.cs (namespace conflict with Editor base class)
  - Created NavMeshBaker.cs editor script for baking NavMesh surfaces via menu item
  - Verified scene loads and runs without errors in play mode

- Files changed
  - Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/Editor/NavMeshBaker.cs - new editor script for NavMesh baking
  - Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/Editor/PowerUpEditor.cs - fixed UnityEditor.Editor namespace conflict
  - Assets/_Tanks/Scenes/TowerSurvivors.unity - added NavMeshSurface to Ground, baked NavMesh
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json - marked US-001 as complete

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - NavMeshSurface component must be added to ground objects and BuildNavMesh() called to bake
  - Editor scripts in namespaces that might conflict need fully qualified `UnityEditor.Editor` base class
  - Creating menu items via [MenuItem] attribute allows programmatic baking via execute_menu_item
  - Scene must be saved after NavMesh baking to persist the NavMesh data
  - NavMesh errors ("SetDestination" can only be called on active agent on NavMesh) indicate missing or unbaked NavMesh
