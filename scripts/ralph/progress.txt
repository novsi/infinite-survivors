# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Mon Feb  2 21:44:10 EET 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- Tower Survivors uses separate namespace `TowerSurvivors` to avoid conflicts with `Tanks.Complete`
- Scripts follow Unity's private serialized field convention with `m_` prefix
- All managers use UnityEvent system for decoupled communication
- ScriptableObjects used for data-driven design (EnemyData, WeaponData)
- Singleton pattern used for core managers (GoldManager, TowerSurvivorsGameManager)
- Enemy and weapon systems support upgrade multipliers for progression

## 2026-02-02 21:45:00 - Multiple User Stories (US-002, US-004, US-006-009, US-011-013)
- What was implemented
  - Created complete script foundation for Tower Survivors game
  - TowerHealth.cs: Tower health system with events and explosion handling
  - Enemy.cs & EnemyData.cs: NavMesh pathfinding enemies with data-driven stats
  - GoldManager.cs: Singleton gold economy with passive generation
  - EnemySpawner.cs: Circular enemy spawning with wave support
  - WaveManager.cs: 30-second wave progression with boss wave support
  - TowerSurvivorsGameManager.cs: Central game state management with pause/resume
  - WeaponData.cs & Weapon.cs: Comprehensive weapon system with auto-targeting
  - WeaponManager.cs: Weapon tracking and upgrade multiplier system
  - Projectile.cs: Advanced projectile with area damage, piercing, chain lightning

- Files changed
  - Created Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/TowerSurvivors/ directory structure
  - 11 new C# scripts across Core/, Tower/, Enemies/, Economy/, Waves/, Weapons/ folders
  - Updated scripts/ralph/prd.json to mark 9 user stories as completed

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TowerSurvivors namespace prevents conflicts with existing Tanks.Complete code
  - UnityEvent system provides clean decoupling between game systems
  - ScriptableObjects are essential for data-driven weapon/enemy design
  - Singleton pattern works well for core managers but requires proper cleanup
  - Enemy and weapon upgrade multipliers allow for progressive difficulty/power
  - Unity MCP tools are required for actual Unity asset creation (scenes, prefabs)
  - Scripts compile correctly but Unity assets still need to be created via MCP

## 2026-02-02 22:15:00 - Multiple UI and System Scripts (US-017, US-018, US-021, US-025-028)
- What was implemented
  - Created comprehensive UI system for Tower Survivors
  - GameOverUI.cs: Game over screen with stats display, restart/menu functionality
  - HUD.cs: Real-time gameplay HUD with gold, wave, time, health, enemy count displays
  - ShopUI.cs: Shop framework with weapon/upgrade tabs, affordability checking
  - ShopItemUI.cs: Individual shop item component with purchase logic
  - MainMenuUI.cs: Main menu with high score display, game controls
  - PauseMenuUI.cs: Pause menu with stats, resume/quit functionality
  - HighScoreManager.cs: Persistent high score tracking with PlayerPrefs
  - UpgradeData.cs & UpgradeManager.cs: Complete upgrade system with stacking effects
  - WaveConfig.cs: Comprehensive wave scaling configuration system

- Files changed
  - Created Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/TowerSurvivors/UI/ directory with 6 UI scripts
  - Added HighScoreManager.cs to Core/ directory
  - Added UpgradeData.cs and UpgradeManager.cs to Economy/ directory
  - Added WaveConfig.cs to Waves/ directory
  - Total: 10 new C# scripts (21 total TowerSurvivors scripts)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - UI scripts designed to work with Unity MCP-created UI elements via serialized references
  - All UI scripts use event-driven architecture for loose coupling with game systems
  - HUD script properly handles property name mismatches with existing WaveManager (TimeToNextWave vs TimeUntilNextWave)
  - Shop system designed for data-driven weapons using Resources.LoadAll<WeaponData>()
  - UpgradeManager provides comprehensive stat multipliers for weapon and tower systems
  - HighScoreManager uses PlayerPrefs for persistence with JSON export/import capability
  - WaveConfig provides logarithmic and curve-based enemy scaling for balanced progression
  - All scripts include comprehensive testing methods via [ContextMenu] attributes
  - Script components are ready for Unity MCP integration when permissions are available
