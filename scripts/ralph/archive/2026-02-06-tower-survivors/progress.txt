# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Fri Feb  6 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- Tower Survivors uses separate namespace `TowerSurvivors` to avoid conflicts with `Tanks.Complete`
- Scripts follow Unity's private serialized field convention with `m_` prefix
- All managers use UnityEvent system for decoupled communication
- ScriptableObjects used for data-driven design (EnemyData, WeaponData, UpgradeData)
- Singleton pattern used for core managers (GoldManager, TowerSurvivorsGameManager)
- UI scripts are in Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/TowerSurvivors/UI/
- UI uses TextMeshPro for all text elements
- HUDCanvas uses Screen Space Overlay with CanvasScaler
- Unity MCP manage_components set_property uses {"instanceID": id} format for object references on scene instances
- Target design reference: scripts/ralph/Target.png
